This is an example app used to showcase [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) testing. The application uses every API command in Cypress for demonstration purposes. Additionally this example app is configured to run tests in various CI platforms. The [tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink/blob/master/cypress/integration) are also heavily commented. For a full reference of our documentation, go to [docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/).

Cypress team has created a full workshop showing how to run Cypress on popular CI providers. Find the workshop at [github.com/cypress-io/cypress-workshop-ci](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-workshop-ci).

## Help + Testing

### 1. Fork this repo

If you want to experiment with running this project in Continous Integration, you'll need to [fork](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink#fork-destination-box) it first.

After forking this project in `Github`, run these commands:

```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-kitchensink

## install the node_modules
npm install

## start the local webserver
npm start
```

The `npm start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8080` which hosts the Kitchen Sink App.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

You should see the Kitchen Sink App up and running. We are now ready to run Cypress tests.

```bash
## launch the cypress test runner
npm run cy:open
```

**shortcut:** you can use command `npm run local:open` that uses [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) to start local server and open Cypress. When you close Cypress, the local server is stopped automatically. Similarly you can use `npm run local:run` to start the server, run Cypress tests headlessly and close the server.
